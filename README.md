# AI Text Detector

![Project Logo](static/images/logo.png) <!-- Add your logo if available -->

**Created by Mike Pinku**

A Flask-based web application that detects whether text was written by a human or generated by AI (specifically GPT-2). The application includes a web interface, user dashboard, and REST API.

## Features

- üïµÔ∏è AI vs Human text detection using GPT-2 perplexity analysis
- üìä Detailed text statistics (word count, readability score, etc.)
- üìà User dashboard with analysis history and metrics
- üîë API access with rate limiting
- üë§ User authentication and accounts
- üìÅ File upload support (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- üì± Responsive design for all devices

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **AI Model**: Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js
- **Database**: (Mock database - replace with real DB in production)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikePinku/ai-text-detector.git
cd ai-text-detector
```bash

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the GPT-2 model (will happen automatically on first run)

5. Run the application:
python app.py

6. Access the application at:
http://localhost:5000

## API Documentation

The application provides a REST API for text analysis. See the API Documentation after running the application for complete details.

Example API Request:
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5000/api/detect \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"The text you want to analyze..."}'

## Configuration

Before deploying to production, make sure to:

1. Set a proper secret key in app.py:
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-here'  # Change this!

2. Replace the mock databases with a real database system

3. Configure proper file storage for uploads
